### **Project Proposal: Dial Thing**  

#### **Overview**  
**Dial Thing** is a compact and innovative rotary-and-press input device designed to perform custom actions seamlessly. It simplifies workflows, boosts productivity, and offers a tactile alternative to traditional input methods like keyboards and touchscreens. With a rotating dial to switch modes and a press action to execute commands, Dial Thing provides a unique and satisfying interaction experience.  

#### **Key Features**  
1. **Rotary Dial for Modes**:  
   - Rotate to navigate through modes such as media control, app switching, custom macros, and more.  
2. **Press Action**:  
   - Trigger specific actions like play/pause, mute, or custom commands with a press.  
3. **Customizable Profiles**:  
   - Personalize modes and actions via a companion app, allowing endless customization.  
4. **LED Indicators**:  
   - A ring of LEDs shows the current mode and enhances the device’s aesthetics.  
5. **Compact and Minimalist Design**:  
   - Desk-friendly, sleek form factor, perfect for professionals, gamers, and creators.  

#### **Target Audience**  
1. **Office Workers**: Simplify multitasking with quick app switching and shortcuts.  
2. **Creatives**: Enhance precision in tools like Photoshop, Premiere Pro, or Figma.  
3. **Gamers**: Access gaming macros and controls with a tactile knob.  
4. **Productivity Enthusiasts**: Replace repetitive shortcuts with an intuitive device.  

#### **Use Cases**  
- Adjust volume, brightness, or playback with a twist.  
- Switch between applications or windows.  
- Execute macros for gaming or creative tasks.  
- Toggle smart home devices or ambient settings.  

#### **Project Goals**  
- **Hardware**: Design and manufacture a custom PCB with a rotary encoder, RGB LEDs, and microcontroller (e.g., ESP32).  
- **Software**: Create firmware to handle rotary and press inputs and a desktop app for action configuration.  
- **Aesthetics**: Ensure the design is ergonomic, visually appealing, and desk-friendly.  

#### **Development Plan**  
1. **Research and Planning**  
   - Study existing rotary encoder projects and gather inspiration.  
   - List hardware and software requirements.  
2. **Prototyping**  
   - Build an initial version using a breadboard, rotary encoder, and Arduino/ESP32.  
   - Test basic functionality: mode switching and action execution.  
3. **PCB Design**  
   - Learn PCB design tools like KiCad or EasyEDA.  
   - Create a PCB with necessary components: rotary encoder, LEDs, microcontroller, resistors.  
   - Order PCB prototypes for testing.  
4. **Firmware Development**  
   - Write code for the microcontroller to interpret rotary and press inputs.  
   - Enable USB/Bluetooth communication with a computer.  
5. **Companion App**  
   - Build a user-friendly app for customizing actions and modes.  
   - Use frameworks like Electron or Swift (macOS-specific).  
6. **Testing and Iteration**  
   - Refine hardware and software based on user feedback.  
   - Ensure low latency, robust connectivity, and intuitive functionality.  
7. **Production**  
   - Finalize PCB design and manufacturing.  
   - Prepare for small-scale production or DIY kits.  

#### **Challenges**  
- Designing a compact yet functional PCB as a first-time designer.  
- Ensuring compatibility across platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
- Balancing simplicity and versatility for users.  

#### **Why It’s Unique**  
Dial Thing combines a minimalist design with maximum functionality. Its focus on tactile interaction and simplicity sets it apart from traditional macro pads and touch-based controllers.  

#### **Future Extensions**  
- Add haptic feedback for a more immersive experience.  
- Integrate a small e-ink or OLED display for mode labels.  
- Expand compatibility with mobile devices or smart home systems.  

Dial Thing has the potential to become an indispensable tool for anyone who values efficiency, creativity, and tactile satisfaction.
